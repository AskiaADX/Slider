Version 1.1.0

Added the interconnection between sliders property.
> This option link all the sliders between each other, so that the sum of the values of each slider within the loop do not go beyond a fixed maximum.
> A checkbox appears near each slider to fix its value.
> When a slider is moved, the value of all the other sliders is recalculated to fit the maximum sum defined in the properties.
> The value of each frozen slider is fixed, and not recalculated, but taken into account to calculate the value of the others.
